## Traditional patching and the need for Managed patching.

Operating System (OS) security patches are critical for safeguarding systems against vulnerabilities that malicious actors could exploit. These patches help ensure your system remains protected against emerging threats. Traditionally, customers have relied on nightly updates, such as [unattended upgrades in Ubuntu](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticSecurityUpdates) or [Automatic Guest OS Patching](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/automatic-vm-guest-patching) at the virtual machine (VM) level. However, when kernel security packages were updated, a host machine reboot was often required, typically managed using tools like [kured](https://github.com/kubereboot/kured). 

This approach, while effective, introduced challenges. Untested or uncontrolled security packages occasionally caused outages, emphasizing the need for a more reliable and managed patching mechanism at the node level. Additionally, maintaining reboot daemonsets like [kured](https://github.com/kubereboot/kured) added operational overhead for many customers. Ideally, customers prefer managed Kubernetes services, such as Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), to handle OS security patching comprehensively and seamlessly.

## Automatic Node OS Security Patching mechanisms at AKS

AKS provides two managed and tested mechanisms to deliver the latest security packages to your Node Operating System. Learn more about [OS Security Patch](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/auto-upgrade-node-os-image?tabs=azure-cli).

**Automatic Node Image Channel** - AKS updates nodes weekly with a newly patched VHD for security and bug fixes. This update follows maintenance windows and upgrade configuration settings. Linux unattended upgrades are disabled by default when using this channel. Automatic Node image upgrades are supported as long as the cluster's Kubernetes minor version is in support. These AKS-tested node images are fully managed and applied with safe deployment practices.

**OS Security Patch Channel** - Several customers may need only the security packages for their OS without additional bug fixes and updates. The OS Security Patch channel provides a fully managed, attended Node OS security-only solution. It automates manual processes, eliminating the need for tools like KURED to reboot nodes for kernel updates. The Security-Patch channel reimages nodes only when necessary and provides live security patching updates with zero disruption, respecting planned maintenance windows and follows azure safe deployment practices.

## Comparison between OS Security Patch channel and Automatic Node Image Channel


| Category                     | Verdict                                  | Why                                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Speed of Patching**       | OS Security Patch Channel wins            | Delivers updates 1 to 2 weeks faster, addressing critical vulnerabilities (CVEs) promptly.           |
| **Disruptions to Workload** | OS Security Patch Channel wins            | Focuses solely on security packages, minimizing disruptions. Reimages 60-70% less frequently and does live security patching other times.        |
| **Handling Capacity Constraints** | OS Security Patch Channel wins            | Reduces surging by reimaging less frequently, ideal for capacity-constrained regions or SKUs.         |
| **Bug Fixes and Binaries**  | Node Image Channel wins                   | Includes bug fixes and additional binaries, providing a more comprehensive update approach.           |
| **Cost**                    | Node Image Channel wins             | OS Security Patch incurs additional costs due to Azure Compute Gallery usage. For details, refer to the [Azure Compute Gallery billing documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/azure-compute-gallery#billing). |

## In Conclusion 
If you need updates beyond security patches, such as bug fixes or additional binaries, the Node Image channel is ideal. It offers comprehensive updates, including both security and functionality improvements. However, for faster security updates with minimal disruptions and fewer node reimages, the OS Security Patch channel is better suited, especially in capacity-constrained environments. Note that the OS Security Patch channel has a small additional cost due to Azure Compute Gallery usage.

## How to Enable OS Security Patch Channel?
You can enable the OS Security Patch Channel using the API, CLI, or the AKS portal. For detailed CLI configuration steps, refer to this [guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/auto-upgrade-node-os-image?tabs=azure-cli#set-the-node-os-autoupgrade-channel-on-a-new-cluster).

## Best Practices when using OS Security Patch Channel
   
 Here are some tips to go about doing this. 

- **Configure Maintenance Windows**: Configure [Planned Maintenance window](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/planned-maintenance?tabs=azure-cli) to apply security patches during periods of low activity. This minimizes the impact on workloads and ensures that updates are applied seamlessly. 
- **Configure Cluster Auto-Upgrade Channel**: To maximize the benefits of OS security patches, it is recommended to enable the SecurityPatch channel alongside the [Kubernetes cluster auto upgrade channel](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/auto-upgrade-cluster?tabs=azure-cli). This dual-channel approach ensures that both the control plane and node pools are kept up-to-date with the latest security patches.
- **Configure Upgrade Monitoring**: Regularly monitor the status of ongoing upgrades to ensure that patches are applied successfully. Utilize tools such as the [AKS Communication Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/aks-communication-manager) to get periodic notifications on OS Patching updates. 
- **Use Release Tracker**: [AKS release tracker](https://releases.aks.azure.com/webpage/index.html) provides region by region updates on what security patch version runs in a particular region.Â These real-time updates are crucial for closely tracking CVEs. There is also a AKS CVE status tab.![Screenshot of the AKS release tracker showing region-specific security patch updates!](/AKS/assets/images/enhance-security-with-os-security-patch/sec-patch-reltracker.jpg).


### What Is Coming Next for OS Security Patch?

The future of OS security patches promises several enhancements aimed at improving the patching process and ensuring even greater security:

- [Support for Network Isolated Cluster](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4962).
- [Snapshotting similar to Ubuntu in Azure Linux](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4963).
- [Kubelet and ContainerD patching via OS security patch](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4964).
- [Support for Windows environment](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4989).
