## Accelerating Open-Source Innovation with AKS and Bitnami on Azure Marketplace

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) combined with Bitnami's open-source solutions available on Azure Marketplace streamlines and accelerates the deployment of your Kubernetes workloads that depend on widely-used open-source projects.

Bitnami's ready-to-use Azure Kubernetes apps simplify the process by leveraging the CNAB packaging format. This means you don't need to write deployment code with Helm, YAML, or custom scripts— just deploy and go.

Combining the highly managed Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) platform with Bitnami's open-source solutions on Azure Marketplace streamlines the deployment of Kubernetes workloads that rely on popular open-source projects, allowing teams to focus on innovation rather than infrastructure management.

### Why AKS + Bitnami OSS?

✔ Instant Open-Source Deployments on AKS

Bitnami's Kubernetes-optimized OSS solutions let you deploy databases, web apps, developer tools, and more on AKS quickly.

- **Deploy faster** – Get up and running in minutes with pre-configured applications. Deploy one-click via Azure marketplace onto your AKS cluster.
- **Reduce operational overhead** – Let AKS manage infrastructure while Bitnami provides security-hardened OSS solutions.
- **Ensure enterprise-grade reliability** – Built-in Azure scaling and monitoring keep applications running smoothly.
- **Simplified Kubernetes Management**: AKS is a fully managed Kubernetes platform that handles infrastructure complexities, freeing your team from operational burdens like cluster upgrades and patching. The Bitnami packaged OSS apps manage the application lifecycle, further reducing your workload.
- **Enhanced Security and Reliability**: Bitnami's open-source Kubernetes apps on Azure Marketplace are pre-packaged, secure, and rigorously certified. Each app undergoes thorough vulnerability scans and regular updates to ensure security and reliability.
- **Innovate with open source**: By using Bitnami's open-source strengths, you gain flexibility, transparency, and community-driven innovation. This helps your team build confidently on proven technology stacks, using popular open-source projects in your AKS workloads.

### Better Together: AKS + Bitnami OSS for Cloud-Native Success

By combining the power of AKS with Bitnami's trusted open-source applications, organizations can:

- **✔Strengthen security posture** – Bitnami apps are pre-hardened, regularly updated, and scanned for vulnerabilities, while AKS provides built-in features like RBAC, network policies, and automated patching to safeguard your workloads.
- **✔ Deploy faster** – Get up and running in minutes with pre-configured applications. Deploy one-click via Azure marketplace onto your AKS cluster.
- **✔ Ensure enterprise-grade reliability** – Built-in Azure scaling and monitoring keep applications running smoothly.
